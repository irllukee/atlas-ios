# Placeholder Text Alignment Fix

## Problem Fixed
The placeholder text "Start writing..." and the blinking cursor in the TextEditor were not properly aligned, creating a visual misalignment that looked strange.

## Root Cause
The placeholder text had different horizontal padding than the TextEditor:
- **Placeholder text**: `.padding(.horizontal, 20)` 
- **TextEditor**: `.padding(.horizontal, 16)`

This created a 4-point horizontal misalignment between the placeholder text and where the cursor would appear when typing.

## Solution Implemented
Changed the placeholder text padding to match the TextEditor:
```swift
// Before
Text("Start writing...")
    .padding(.horizontal, 20)  // ❌ Misaligned

// After  
Text("Start writing...")
    .padding(.horizontal, 16)  // ✅ Aligned with TextEditor
```

## Result
- ✅ Placeholder text and cursor are now perfectly aligned
- ✅ Visual consistency when transitioning from placeholder to actual text
- ✅ Professional appearance that matches iOS design standards

## Files Modified
- `Atlas/Views/Notes/CreateNoteView.swift` - Fixed padding alignment in contentField

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ App launched successfully in simulator
- ✅ Alignment fix applied and ready for testing
