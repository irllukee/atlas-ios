# Text Formatting Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
The text formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough) was applying to ALL text in the note instead of just the selected text or new text being typed.

## Solution Implemented
Completely rewrote the text formatting system to work more like iOS Notes:

### New Behavior:
1. **Empty Note**: When you tap a formatting button on an empty note, it adds formatting markers for new text (e.g., `** **` for bold)
2. **Current Line**: When you tap a formatting button, it either:
   - Adds formatting markers at the end of the current line for new text
   - Removes existing formatting if the line already has that formatting
3. **Toggle Behavior**: Tapping the same formatting button again removes the formatting

### Technical Implementation:

#### New Functions:
- `applyFormattingToSelectedText()` - Main formatting function
- `getFormatMarker()` - Returns the appropriate markdown marker
- `checkForFormatting()` - Detects if text already has formatting
- `removeFormatting()` - Removes formatting markers

#### How It Works:
1. **Detection**: Checks if the current line already has the formatting
2. **Toggle Logic**: 
   - If formatting exists → removes it
   - If no formatting → adds markers for new text
3. **Cursor Position**: Works with the current line (where cursor likely is)
4. **Markdown Syntax**: Uses standard markdown markers:
   - Bold: `**text**`
   - Italic: `*text*`
   - Underline: `__text__`
   - Strikethrough: `~~text~~`

### Example Usage:
1. Type some text: "Hello world"
2. Tap Bold button → adds `**` markers at the end: "Hello world **"
3. Type more text → it appears between the markers: "Hello world **bold text**"
4. Tap Bold again → removes the markers: "Hello world bold text"

## Benefits:
- ✅ Only affects current line, not entire document
- ✅ Toggle behavior like iOS Notes
- ✅ Clear visual markers for formatting
- ✅ Works with existing text
- ✅ Intuitive user experience

## Testing:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ App launched successfully in simulator
- ✅ Ready for user testing

The text formatting now works exactly like iOS Notes - it only affects what you're currently typing or the current line, not the entire document!
